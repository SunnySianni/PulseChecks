**Problem Statement**
The project is starting to grow. We need to organize the project files to ensure we are able to scale it and add additional features. 

**Project Scope**
Move ANY embedded or inline CSS into a separate file and link it to your HTML page. 
Remove any JavaScript from HTML to a separate file with a name that identifies the file's purpose. Add a feature request form and button to allow users to request additional features. Style the form and button using the linked CSS file. 
Refactor your JavaScript to use functions and function parameters where necessary
